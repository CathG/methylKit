methylKit 0.5
--------------

NEW FUNCTIONS AND FEATURES

* new function reorganize() can be used to reorganize methylRawList and methylBase objects to create new objects from subset of samples or can be used to change the order of samples and treatment vector.

* new function bedgraph() can output UCSC bedgraph files for methylRaw and methylDiff objects

* new function percMethylation() extracts percent methylation values from a methylBase object and returns a matrix

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* regionCounts() bug that appeared with data.table 1.8.0 is fixed

* unite() bug that appeared with R 2.15 is fixed

* unite() now can merge bases/regions that are not covered by all samples by setting "min.per.replicate" option

* calculateDiffMeth() can deal with NA values introduced by setting "min.per.replicate" option of unite() function

* PCASamples() now uses "prcomp" function to do the PCA analysis

* external annotation data (cpgi.hg18.bed.txt and refseq.hg18.bed.txt) that comes with the package is now only a subset of full datasets. Do not use them for your own analysis, download the complete annotation data from UCSC or other sources in BED format.

methylKit 0.4.1
--------------

NEW FUNCTIONS AND FEATURES

* new function select() can be used to subset methylRaw, methylBase and methylDiff objects to create new objects with a subset of methylation data useful if you want to use only a particular portion of methylation events on the genome.

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* read.bismark bug fixed, now it should be able to save methylation call files with no problem

methylKit 0.4
--------------

NEW FUNCTIONS AND FEATURES

* New read.bismark() function can read directly from a sorted SAM file output by Bismark aligner, the function can save methylation calls as text files or read them as methylRaw object to be used in analysis

* calculateDiffMeth() can do all differential methylation calculations using multiple-cores if 'num.cores' is set to an integer denoting how many cores should be used.

* getCoverageStats() & getMethylationStats() have a new option called 'labels', if set to FALSE, no labels will be drawn on top of the histogram bars.

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* cov.bases option in tileMethylCounts() now works

* methylRaw,methylBase and methylDiff objects have a new slot 'resolution', which designates
  whether methylation information is base-pair resolution or regional resolution. allowed values 'base' or 'region'

* getCoverageStats() & getMethylationStats() now print the sample ids and methylation context automatically in the 
  title when plotting

* getCoverageStats() & getMethylationStats() takes extra options to be passed to hist() function

* destrand option of unite() function will be over-ridden when methylRawList to be united contains regions rather than bases

* unite() function checks if supplied elements of methylRawList object have the same context,assembly and resolution before
  uniting data sets.

* validity function checking the format of the data for a methylRaw object is implemented

* clusterSamples() and PCASamples() take methylation context information automatically and use it in plot titles

methylKit 0.3.1
--------------

IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES

* syntax error when fisher.test applied at calculateMethDiff() is fixed.
