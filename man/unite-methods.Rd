\title{unites methylRawList to a single table}
\usage{
  unite(.Object,destrand=FALSE,min.per.replicate=NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{.Object}{a methylRawList object to be merged by
  common locations covered by reads}

  \item{destrand}{if TRUE, reads covering both strands of a
  CpG dinucleotide will be merged, do not set to TRUE if
  not only interested in CpGs (default: FALSE). If the
  methylRawList object contains regions rather than bases
  setting destrand to TRUE will have no effect.}

  \item{min.per.replicate}{an integer denoting minimum
  number of samples per replicate needed to cover a
  region/base. By default only regions/bases that are
  covered in all samples are united as methylBase object,
  however by supplying an integer for this argument users
  can control how many samples needed to cover region/base
  to be united as methylBase object. For example, if
  min.per.replicate set to 2 and there are 3 replicates per
  condition, the bases/regions that are covered in at least
  2 replicates will be united and missing data for
  uncovered bases/regions will appear as NAs.}
}
\value{
  a methylBase object
}
\description{
  This functions unites \code{methylRawList} object that
  only bases with coverage from all samples are retained.
  The resulting object is a class of \code{methylBase}
}
