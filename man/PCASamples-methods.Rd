\arguments{
  \item{.Object}{a \code{methylBase} object}

  \item{cor}{[Not used anymore] cor a logical value
  indicating whether the calculation should use the
  correlation matrix or the covariance matrix. (default:
  TRUE)}

  \item{screeplot}{a logical value indicating whether to
  plot the variances against the number of the principal
  component. (default: FALSE)}

  \item{adj.lim}{a vector indicating the propotional
  adjustment of xlim (adj.lim[1]) and ylim (adj.lim[2]).
  (default: c(0.0004,0.1))}

  \item{scale}{logical indicating if \code{prcomp} should
  scale the data to have unit variance or not (default:
  TRUE)}

  \item{center}{logical indicating if \code{prcomp} should
  center the data or not (default: TRUE)}

  \item{comp}{vector of integers with 2 elements specifying
  which components to be plotted.}

  \item{transpose}{if TRUE (default) percent methylation
  matrix will be transposed, this is equivalent to doing
  PCA on variables that are regions/bases. The resulting
  plot will location of samples in the new coordinate
  system if FALSE the variables for the matrix will be
  samples and the resulting plot whill show how each sample
  (variable) contributes to the principle component.  the
  samples that are highly correlated should have similar
  contributions to the principal components.}

  \item{sd.threshold}{standard deviation threshold to
  remove bases/regions that have % methylation standard
  dev. lower than this threshold.  if NULL no strandard
  deviation will be calculated and this threshold will not
  be applied.}

  \item{obj.return}{if the result of \code{prcomp} function
  should be returned or not. Default:FALSE}
}
\value{
  The form of the value returned by \code{PCASamples} is
  the summary of principal component analysis by
  \code{prcomp}.
