methylBase-class        An S4 class that holds base-pair resolution
                        methylation information for multiple
                        experiments, only bases that are covered in all
                        experiments are held in this class
methylRaw-class         An S4 class for holding raw methylation data
                        from alignment pipeline.
methylRawList-class     An S4 class for holding a list of methylRaw
                        objects.
read                    read file(s) to a methylrawList or methylraw
                        object
unite                   unites methylRawList to a single table
